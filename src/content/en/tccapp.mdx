# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how TCCApp collects, protects, and uses the personally
identifiable information ("Personal Information") you ("User", "you" or "your") may provide in the
RestauranteTM mobile application and any of its products or services (collectively, "Mobile
Application" or "Services"). It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of
your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy does not
apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not
employ or manage.

## Automatic Collection of Information

Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise the no-logs policy. We may
process only minimal user data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain our Mobile
Applications or Services. Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential
cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding Mobile Application traffic and usage.
This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any
particular user of the system.

## Collection of Personal Information

You can use our Mobile Applications without telling us who you are or revealing any information by
which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to
use some of the Mobile Application's features, you may be asked to provide certain Personal
Information (for example, your name and email address). We receive and store any information you
knowingly provide to us when you make a purchase, or fill any online forms in the Mobile
Application. When required, this information may include contact information such as email address,
address, etc.

You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to
take advantage of some of the Mobile Application's features. Users who are uncertain about what
information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.

## Storing Personal Information

We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal
obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is
required or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your
Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you
personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the
right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data portability
cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.

## Use and Processing of Collected Information

In order to make our Mobile Applications and Services available to you, or to meet a legal
obligation, we need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the
information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or
services. Some of the information we collect is directly from you via our Mobile Applications.
However, we may also collect Personal Information about you from other sources.

Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:

- Improve products and services
- Send marketing and promotional communications
- Respond to inquiries and offer support
- Request user feedback
- Improve user experience
- Deliver targeted advertising
- Run and operate our Mobile Applications and Services

Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with our Mobile Applications, where
you are located in the world, and if one of the following applies:

1. You have given your consent for one or more specific purposes. This does not apply when the
   processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer Privacy Act or European data
   protection law.
2. Provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any
   pre-contractual obligations thereof.
3. Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject.
4. Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
   official authority vested in us.
5. Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third
   party.

Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such
processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal
bases below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or
contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

## Information Transfer and Storage

Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in
a country other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information
transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by
public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security
measures taken by us to safeguard your information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find
out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with us using the information
provided in the contact section.

## How to Exercise These Rights

Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to Devegion through the contact details
provided in this document. These requests can be exercised free of charge and will be addressed by
Devegion as early as possible.

## Privacy of Children

If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Information through our Mobile
Applications or Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's
Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide
Personal Information through our Mobile Applications or Services without their permission.

If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Information to
us through our Mobile Applications or Services, please contact us. You must also be at least 16
years of age to consent to the processing of your Personal Information in your country (in some
countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

## Information Security

We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected
from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and
physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and
disclosure of Personal Information in its control and custody. However, no data transmission over
the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your
Personal Information, you acknowledge that:

- (i) There are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control;
- (ii) The security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between
  you and our Mobile Applications cannot be guaranteed;
- (iii) Any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third-party,
  despite best efforts.

## Data Breach

In the event we become aware that the security of our Mobile Applications has been compromised or
users' Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external
activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take
reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well
as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities.

In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we
believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the user as a result of the breach or if notice
is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will post a notice in our Mobile Applications.

## Legal Disclosure

We will disclose any information we collect, use, or receive if required or permitted by law, such
as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that
disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others,
investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. In the event we go through a business
transition, such as a merger or acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its
assets, your user account, and Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred.

## Acceptance of This Policy

You acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to all its terms and conditions. By using
our Mobile Applications or their Services you agree to be bound by this Policy. If you do not agree
to abide by the terms of this Policy, you are not authorized to use or access our Mobile
Applications and their Services. Being a free service, all files and data are stored locally, on
your phone!
